# Agonalysis
An analysis of language, vocalization, and popularity in metal bands that have changed vocalists 

In this analysis, I will look at several parameters: 
1. Number of unique words per song
2. Number of repetition of words or phrases per song 
3. Proportion of vocals that is clean, spoken, or distorted (growl, vocal fry, etc)
4. The number of plays per song and per album
5. Release year of the album and/or single
6. Which singer performed the song/album

This project was inspired by noticing that they lyrics from the band The Agonist changed drastically when their first singer, Alyssa White-Glus, left the band to join Arch Enemy (replacing another singer) and was replaced by a different singer, Vicky Psarakis. The style of the music did not change, nor did the overall lineup, maintaining the overall style of the music, distortion, solos. What did change was the musicality by the singer - fewer unique words, more repetition, easier choruses to sing along to. 

While this is a band I have been listening to since their beginning, there are definitely other bands that have had such lineup changes, such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and the aforementioned Arch Enemy. There have been significant observations of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest albums when they included their current frontmen, Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford, respectively. In the case of Judas Priest, the album sales when the band featured Tim "The Ripper" Owens tanked, not necessarily due to song-writing or performance, but because of fan allegiance to Rob Halford, one of the founders of the band. A big differerence. Iron Maiden is a bit different, as the band was not founded with Bruce, and the band has changed singers multiple times. This brings me to a split in band classification for this analysis: 

There are bands that have been founded on the musicality of the band, regardless of the singer. The band's identity is attached to the style in which they play, and the singer can be replaced with somone either with the same vocal style or someone who sounds completely different, they are still thought of as the same band. Examples of bands that have different sounding singers: Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Iron Maiden. There are also many guitar virtuosos that utilize different singers who all sound very similar. In these cases, the band's name is actually just the name of the lead guitarist. These bands will be excluded. 

Another type of band has developed their sound on the melding of the singer's vocal style, songwriting, and personality with the music. By removing the singer, the band is no longer the same band. This is what happened with Judas Priest and would likely happen if Metallica were to fire James Hetfield, and the list goes on. The problem with these bands are that the other band members (in both of the aforementioned cases) have been replaced without a problem. An interesting case here is with Alice in Chains, where after decades the band successfully replaced their frontman and band personality Layne Staley with William DuVall. 

The third type of band falls into a unique category where all of the members equally balance the music and the vocals of the band. To remove and replace a member requires that the style and personality be as close as possible as the predecessor. Removing a lead guitarist who shreds would require another shredder of equal or more talent. Replacing a singer requires him or her to have the same range, as they will still be singing the older songs while writing the new. This isn't to say that the individual is a clone of the last and doesn't bring their own personality - this is definitely not the case. They are able to maintain the old style and bring in their new style, especially in the new material. It adapts and progresses on an album to album basis just as all bands do, but with more continuity than most bands that change members.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to provide insight as to what is it that makes that particular band's songs and albums successful. This will not apply accross bands, even within the same genre. I will be starting with the band The Agonist, as this is the band that I was first thinking about upon project inception. I will continue to add to this list, but as it is not something that can give broad insight, the specific data will have to be collected per band. 

To provide the ability to assess other bands, the functions will be created such that with proper input, the analyses will be automated to provide insights and results.
